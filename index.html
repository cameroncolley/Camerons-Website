  <p>I grew up in a town called <em>Ballito</em>, in the province of <em>KwaZulu Natal, South Africa</em>. I went to school at Umhlali Preparatory School, then went to high school at <a href="https://maritzburgcollege.co.za/">Maritzburg College</a>,
    in<em> Pietermaritzburg</em> at the age of 14,
    where I made many new friends. I decided to leave <em>"College"</em> and go to school in my home town, the school was called Ashton International College. 2018 was my matriculent year, and I left school persuing a career in yachting, which was
    unfortunatly cut short due to the coronavirus, or COVID 19 pandemic. I waited a while for the opportunity to get overseas, however nothing was really happening. In my third year out of school I went for a trip to Cape Town, where I fell in love
    with the girl of my dreams,<strong> Olivia Bowles</strong>, she gave me motivation to persue a different career path for the time being, and challenge myself in all differnt aspects of life. Currently I have relocated to Cape Town, from my home
    town, to reside with her and push myself out my comfort zone. Having now gained an interest in web development, it has led me to do this bootcamp, with the intention of gaining knowledge in the field. I can't thank both of parents enough for their emmense support, I wouldn't be where I am today without their help. </p>
